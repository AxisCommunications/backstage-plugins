## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [CNCF Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/AxisCommunications/backstage-plugins/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Get Started!

1. Cloning the repository and start the app and backend. Please follow the Backstage offical [Contributing guide](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Here you also find information about coding guidelines, like prettier, and how to run the project locally.

## Api reports

Similar to Backstage upstream, we use api reports generated by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to help us build better TypeScript library packages. To learn more about api-reports and how to generate them, we refer to the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#api-reports).

## Review Process

Once you've submitted a Pull Request (PR), tests will be run and we will have a look at your PR as soon as we can. If we have any comments or questions, we will do so in the PR.

You need approval from one of the core maintainers (in this case, the Backstage team at Axis). Once you have one approval it's ready to be merged, this task is also done by one of us.
