# Contributing to Axis Backstage plugins

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Axis Backstage plugins are released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to this repo are accepted under the same license.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [CNCF Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/AxisCommunications/backstage-plugins/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Get Started!

To clone the repository and start the app and backend, please follow the Backstage offical [Contributing guide](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Here you also find information about coding guidelines, like prettier, and how to run the project locally.

## Changesets

Just like Backstage upstream, we use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to help us prepare releases. By using changsets we can make sure that the process generating releases is easy, and that every change gets a proper version number.

If you wish to know more about the use of **changesets** in Backstage, please read the [official Backstage documentation about changesets](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-changesets).

### How to create a changeset

1. Run `yarn changeset` from the root of the repo
2. Select which packages you want to include a changeset for
3. Select if you wish to use the `minor`, `major`, or `patch` impact. Read more [here](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver) about when to use which impact.
4. Describe your changes in the generated changeset. Backstage upstream has [a well-written guide](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Writing changesets) for how to write these descriptions.
5. Add generated changeset to Git and push this commit to the branch associated with your PR.

## Api reports

Similar to Backstage upstream, we use api reports generated by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to help us build better TypeScript library packages. To learn more about api-reports and how to generate them, we refer to the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#api-reports).

## Review Process

Once you've submitted a Pull Request (PR), tests will be run and we will have a look at your PR as soon as we can. If we have any comments or questions, we will do so in the PR.

You need approval from one of the core maintainers (in this case, the Backstage team at Axis). Once you have one approval it's ready to be merged, this task is also done by one of us.
